# Group Project - Object Oriented Snapchat

For today's group project, you'll be building out the User class of Snapchat from scratch. Fork/Clone this lab (or use the "Open in Nitrous" button). In this directory, make a file called `user.rb`. Code out your User class here!

 Before you start actually coding, spend 5 - 10 minutes planning out how your class will function. Write out in pseudo-code what methods/actions your class should be able to do. 
+ What attributes does that class have?(i.e. username? password?)
+ What actions will they be able to take?
+ What's your MVP (minimum viable product)
+  How can users be able to interact with other users?
